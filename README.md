## Versioning and branches
Velo Supervisor 2000 uses <a href="https://semver.org/" class="text-decoration-none">Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer)</a> as versioning scheme. Versions are expressed as tags. A Github action runs each time the repository receives a commit or a pull request is accepted, and writes the current version to `current_version.txt`. Use these commands to create new tags:
- `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Version X.Y.Z"`
- `git push --tags`

As a principle, development is to be done in dev-branches and will be merged into the master branch as needed. Review the changes in the PR and create a new version tag accordingly before merging.
