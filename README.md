# velo-supervisor-2000
Program to monitor bicycle service intervals

Much work in progress here. There will be a short break during summer months, then coding will continue when autumn comes. Join the work, fork the repo and contribue with PRs!

Known limitations:
Rides deleted from Strava are not deleted in velo supervisor upon sync
Data validation happens frontend, so if you use only APIs make your own validation rules
